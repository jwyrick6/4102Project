#	Project Description:
# This project encompasses the development and application of machine learning models and algorithms within the healthcare domain. This involves the examination of various healthcare data sources, including electronic health records, medical imaging, and data from wearable devices, for purposes such as disease prediction, identifying individuals at higher risk, and improving treatment strategies. Furthermore, the study delves into the ethical aspects surrounding data privacy, model interpretability, and the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence in healthcare environments. Additionally, it explores the potential for broader applications like telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and optimizing healthcare systems, all with the overarching objective of advancing healthcare through the intelligent integration of machine learning for the benefit of both patients and healthcare providers.
