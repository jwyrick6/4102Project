## Project Description
This project encompasses the development and application of machine learning models and algorithms within the healthcare domain. We explore various healthcare data sources, including electronic health records, medical imaging, and data from wearable devices, for purposes such as disease prediction, identifying individuals at higher risk, and improving treatment strategies. The study also delves into the ethical aspects surrounding data privacy, model interpretability, and the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence in healthcare environments.

Additionally, the project explores the potential for broader applications like telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and optimizing healthcare systems. The overarching objective is to advance healthcare through the intelligent integration of machine learning, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.

## Running The Code

The code is written in R, and we are using the "heart.csv" dataset for predicting heatdiseases.

1.Go to rstudio official website from : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

2.Download and Install R

3.Download and Install Rstudio for your operating system

4.Run Rstudio

5.in the console copy and paste this code then press enter:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dslabs", "dplyr", "caret", "lubridate", "tidytext", "RColorBrewer", "randomForest", "tictoc", "e1071", "ggpubr", "GGally", "corrplot", "gridExtra", "transformr", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "glmnet", "pROC", "shiny"))
```

6.Open Rshiny.r (make sure that heart.csv is in the same folder as Rshiny.r)

7.Run the code
